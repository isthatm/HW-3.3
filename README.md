# HW-3.3: UART protocol
This program uses UART protocol to communicate with slave at different modes. If mode is 1, value+1 will be returned. And If mode is 2, value+2 will be returned. Otherwise, the original mode and value will be reuturn. In UART protocol, one bit is transmitted per start and stop bit. Therefore, the mode is sen first, then comes 
the value.
